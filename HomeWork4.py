'''Download the data (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
Process the data ( clean it, tokenize it ) 
Build word embedding 
Build neural network classification 
Train the model 
Calculate accuracy as AUCROC 
Reference: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_classification_rnn  ( do not copy their code , code every step yourself)  (feel free to use pytorch!)
It is ok if your model performance is low.
